<h3 class="pubh3">poetry and writing</h3>
   
<p class="hometext">
  Welcome to my publications page! For two years in middle school, I was really into writing poetry. Some people turn to art and music to convey their emotions, postive or negative. Despite loving to sketch and play my instruments, I found myself turning to writing, something that I felt I didn't exactly "excel" at. My love for writing grew over the years, and I love doing it, as long as I have inspiration and ideas in mind. Below are some of my favorite poems that I have written back then. </p>
   
<div id="poetry">
<img width=307.5 class="poems" src="assets/publications/midjuly.png" alt="a poem titled 'back to mid-july;' the contents are:

Flying kites in mid-July
underneath the cloudless sky

Sunset leaves in October
they are to be remembered

January; crisp as snow
flakes of drifting miracles

April showers will be soon
May it let the flowers bloom

Then the sun shines way up high
Oh, how fast the time flies by

It brings us back to mid-July
underneath the cloudless sky">

<img width=234 class="poems" src="assets/publications/sunshine.png" alt="a poem titled 'Sunshine;' the contents are:
  
You are
The star
Of my universe

Providing me
Warmth
And light

Guiding me forward
By being
My sunshine">
  
<img width=286.5 class="poems" src="assets/publications/heliotropism.png" alt="a poem titled 'Heliotropism;' the contents are:>

let us be
flowers of the sun
in search of sunshine
together
for pursuit of the light
even on the darkest days
i'll be there with you
even when the skies are gray">

  
<img width=350 class="poems" src="assets/publications/desvu.png" alt="a poem titled 'Dès Vu;' here is the poem:
  
Dès Vu - The awareness that this will become a memory

How often are we really aware
That each passing moment
Will become a distant memory

Yet there is nothing we could do
Except to savor the feeling
That each moment brings to us

But because of that
We focus so much
Too much.

On preserving the instance
That we forget to enjoy it ourselves

Taking snapshots
Capturing each moment
Fighting against the passing of time
In this world of being stuck on play

We desperately cling on
Hoping, praying, we don’t forget
But like time, it slips out of our hands
It just sort of happens

So how often are we really in the moment
Feeling the feelings we feel
And unafraid of it
Becoming a distant memory?">

  After I somewhat outgrown writing poetry, I picked up something else. It started with a simple writing assignment about mood in my 9th grade English class. Since then, I began to pay more attention to the moods of the songs I listen to and what kind of scenario my head makes up in the meantime. Sometimes, random inspiration hits, and I just feel the need to turn it into a story if the inspiration is great enough. These are just short (really short) stories/excerpts that I have written over the past year or so, just for fun and to practice writing.</p>

  I haven't gotten the time to sit myself down and write for a good while now. Nor have I been inspired to write something lately. In my opinion, some of these are really corny, but some of them are pretty cute. The button below will redirect you to my work if you would like to check it out.</p>
